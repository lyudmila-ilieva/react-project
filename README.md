This was a 3 week long project built during my React course at Software University, Bulgaria. 
Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

I built an application that allows users to view products after register/login. 
Users can view all existing products, they can add new ones, see details of all products and add all products to their Wishlist. 
Once added to Wishlist, they can view their favourite products and remove them if they want. 
Also users can see products added by them, edit the price of their products and delete them.

I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding react-router-dom. 

### I have used these libraries:

#### Authentication/Database
#### `npm i firebase`

#### Validation
#### `react-hook-form`
#### `npm install @hookform/resolvers`
#### `npm install -S yup`

#### Unique id
#### `npm install uuidv4`

#### Toast Component
#### `react-toast-component`
#### `react-toastify`

#### Google Maps
#### `@react-google-maps/api`
#### `@reach/combobox`

I have used Firebase Authentication and Firestore as a database.
The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Java Script, HTML and CSS.
